# Twixt

An online recreation of the classic Twixt board game coming soon.
Features implemented so far:
    >User accounts
    >Friend / follow system
    >Notifications ( could be improved )
    >Real-time chats between players and on each game

Still needed:
    >The actual game logic :)
    >Remove all references to 'theSource' which is a previous project that I started with as a base.
    >Add more profile personalization options
    >Actually use bootstrap to make the game mobile friendly.
